# Codesmith Deep Learning Pre-Course

Welcome to Codesmith Deep Learning! In this course, we will develop the experience and expertise required to train, deploy, and analyze deep learning models.

Whether you are a software engineer who wants to know how you can start implementing machine learning models in your current job, a data scientist who wants to add neural networks to their tool belt, or an intermediate/advanced python coder who wants to see what deep learning is all about, this course has something to offer anyone that is interested in neural networks and the future of machine learning.

If you haven't already, please join our slack team - you should have an email from slack inviting you to join the team. We'll use slack throughout the course to share helpful resources and learning materials, ask and answer stack overlow-style questions when people are stuck on coding challenges, and communicate about all things related to this course.

# What to expect from the course

We value building an inclusive and supportive community. Above all, you should expect to cultivate empathetic technical and non-technical communication with your peers. After all, engineering doesn't happen in isolation - it happens in teams. If you are kind and thoughtful in your communication, you should expect to build a network of bright and ambitious peers that will help further your career in machine learning.

In addition to community building, the Codesmith team is dedicated to developing ambitious and groundbreaking curriculum and pedagogy. We seek to challenge our program participants to think deeply and engage critically with code they write and with the code their peers write. While we can provide a path for our students to follow, ultimately it's up to each of you to provide the engine that powers you down that path. Put simply, what you put in is what you will get out.

A professor in a research seminar once told me, "the student that learns and creates the most in this seminar will neglect their other studies, they will be singly focused on the research at hand." I was not the student that learned the most in that seminar - I understand that our program participants have jobs and families and many other responsibilities. Part of the reason we've chosen to offer this as an online course is due to the flexibility this affords our participants. But if you are willing and able to put in extra time coding and studying the material covered in instructional hours, you will come away with a fuller understanding of the power and applications of machine learning.

Lastly, you will learn that no code is sacred. Throughout the course, we provide you with some boilerplate code and, occasionally, test cases to guide towards thoughtful, concise solutions to the problems you are expected to solve. Don't take this code for granted. Read it, study it, understand it, and alter it if it doesn't lead you towards the approach that seems most natural to you.

# What to expect from the pre-course

In order to hit the ground running on the first day of class, you've got to be prepared to write clear, concise python code. Priority number one for this pre-course is to lay the strong foundation of python skills that will enable you to succeed in the rest of the course. Along the way you will be exposed to important foundational concepts of machine learning.

Throughout CSDL, we'll rely heavily on a scientific computing platform called *Jupyter*. Jupyter is a wonderful scientfic and educational tool with too many incredible features to list. Priority number two for the pre-course is to get you off the ground with Jupyter. Jupyter is heavily used in industry, and will allow you to create expressive notebooks and presentations that document the machine learning work you've done.

As you work on the pre-course, you can expect to:

* be challenged to write clear and creative code
* use resources like google, stack overflow, and official python and numpy documentation to answer your questions
* use the #help-desk channel in the CSDL slack if you are stuck on a problem for more than a half hour (see the *Using #help-desk in slack* section below)
* keep an optimistic attitude as you overcome difficult technical challenges
* have questions about parts of the pre-course that are particularly difficult or confusing for you (we will discuss on day one of the course)
* learn to comfortably navigate jupyter notebooks
* see new ways to use python's object oriented features
* use python's magic methods to build sophisticated custom classes
* build a working machine learning model that is heavily used in industry from scratch

# Setting up your environment

We'll be using Anaconda3 throughout this course. Anaconda3 provides users with a scientific computing environment suitable for a variety of machine learning tasks.

## Anaconda3 - Installation Guide

Visit the anaconda installation site [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

Download the Anaconda (please download the Python 3.6 version with the Command-Line Installer).

Once you've downloaded the installer, follow the instructions located [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install).

To verify the necessary tools have been setup, open up a terminal and run the comman `jupyter --version`. This should print something like `4.4.0`. If this command doesn't work, make sure you have followed the instructions in the intallation guide that show you how to update your `PATH` environment variable.

# Precourse instructions

1. Create a fork of this repository on Github.
1. Open up a new terminal and navigate to the directory you would like to keep your course materials in. Run `git clone <url for your fork>` to download your repository locally.
1. If you have trouble with these steps please reach out to us on the #help-desk channel in Slack!
1. In your terminal, navigate to the repo you've just cloned, and then navigate to the `precourse` directory.
1. Run the command `jupyter notebook`. A web browser window will popup displaying the files in this directory.
1. Click on the `jupyternotebooks.ipynb` file to get started.
1. When you are done with `jupyternotebooks.ipynb`, move on to `knn.ipynb`.

## Using #help-desk in slack

The more information you provide us with about the problems you are facing, the easier it will be for your peers and myself to offer you advice and guidance. I highly recommend using [stackoverflow's guide for asking questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

If you haven't provided a detailed account of the problem you are facing, you may be asked to rephrase or rewrite your question.

*Good luck completing the pre-course - we look forward to seeing you on day one of class!*
