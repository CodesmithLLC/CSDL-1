# CSDL Precourse

Welcome to the CSDL pre-course! In order to hit the ground running on the first day of class, you've got to be prepared to write clear, concise python code. Priority number one for this pre-course is to lay the strong foundation of python skills that will enable you to succeed in the rest of the course. Along the way you will be exposed to important foundational concepts of machine learning.

Throughout CSDL, we'll rely heavily on a scientific computing platform called *Jupyter*. Jupyter is a wonderful scientfic and educational tool with too many incredible features to list. Priority number two for the pre-course is to get you off the ground with Jupyter. Jupyter is heavily used in industry, and will allow you to create expressive notebooks and presentations that document the machine learning work you've done.

As you work on the pre-course, you can expect to:

* be challenged to write clear and creative code
* use resources like google, stack overflow, and official python and numpy documentation to answer your questions
* use the #help-desk channel in the CSDL slack if you are stuck on a problem for more than a half hour (see the *Using #help-desk in slack* section below)
* keep an optimistic attitude as you overcome difficult technical challenges
* have questions about parts of the pre-course that are particularly difficult or confusing for you (we will discuss on day one of the course)
* learn to comfortably navigate jupyter notebooks
* see new ways to use python's object oriented features
* use python's magic methods to build sophisticated custom classes
* build a working machine learning model that is heavily used in industry from scratch

# Setting up your environment

We'll be using Anaconda3 throughout this course. Anaconda3 provides users with a scientific computing environment suitable for a variety of machine learning tasks.

## Anaconda3 - Installation Guide

Visit the anaconda installation site [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download).

Download the Anaconda (please download the Python 3.6 version with the Command-Line Installer).

Once you've downloaded the installer, follow the instructions located [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install).

To verify the necessary tools have been setup, open up a terminal and run the comman `jupyter --version`. This should print something like `4.4.0`. If this command doesn't work, make sure you have followed the instructions in the intallation guide that show you how to update your `PATH` environment variable.

# Precourse instructions

1. If you haven't already, please fork and clone this repo. Instructions for this can be found in the README in the home directory of this repository.
1. In your terminal, navigate to the repo you've just cloned, and then navigate to the `precourse` directory.
1. Run the command `jupyter notebook`. A web browser window will popup displaying the files in this directory.
1. Click on the `jupyternotebooks.ipynb` file to get started.
1. When you are done with `jupyternotebooks.ipynb`, move on to `knn.ipynb`.

## Using #help-desk in slack

The more information you provide us with about the problems you are facing, the easier it will be for your peers and myself to offer you advice and guidance. I highly recommend using [stackoverflow's guide for asking questions](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

If you haven't provided a detailed account of the problem you are facing, you may be asked to rephrase or rewrite your question.

*Good luck completing the pre-course - we look forward to seeing you on day one of class!*
